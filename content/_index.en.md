Welcome to my presentation site. 

My name is Simon and I have been a freelance translator since March 2020. After working in a translation agency in Madrid, I am now embarking on an entrepreneurial adventure to fulfill my passion full time.

 Here you can discover my experience, my professional and personal projects, my rates and my areas of specialization. 

I am at your entire disposal, whatever the time or date. Contact me without hesitation for any questions or requests for quotes at meriadec.simon@gmail.com.

I wish you a pleasant day and a good visit of the site.
