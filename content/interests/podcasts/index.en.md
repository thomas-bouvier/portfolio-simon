# Explanations

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Now what? Okay, I like a challenge. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. You can see how I lived before I met you. Bite my shiny metal ass. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Ooh, name it after me! Tell them I hate them. Take me to your leader! Shut up and take my money!

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I wish! It's a nickel. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Pansy. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.
